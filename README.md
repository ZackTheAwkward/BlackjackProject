# BlackjackProject


### Description
The object of this program is to simulate a blackjack table to an extent. The player and dealer would be dealt a hand for blackjack, the program would check and make sure either player wasn't dealt a blackjack, and if they were the winner was checked. If no blackjacks were dealt, the program would continue to the next step, asking the user if they would like to hit or stand. If the user chose to hit, they would be looped into the option of hitting until either they busted, or they chose the option to stand which ended their turn, and began the dealer's turn. Once the dealer's turn began, the program would check the dealer's hand value. If the dealers hand value was greater than the players, his turn would end, and the dealer won. If his hand value was greater than 17, his turn would end, and the program would check for a winner. Otherwise if the dealer's hand was less than 17, the dealer would draw cards until his hand was either greater than 17, or would stop if the dealer busted and the user would win. From their the user was given the option to keep the program going and get dealt a new hand, or the option to walk away from the table.
### Technologies used
Once again this project tied in multiple technologies that were taught throughout the cohort.
- UML to design project layout and class structure
- Object Oriented Programming
- Use of Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods
- Use of Scanner to take in user input
- Various loops such as For/For each/While loops
- Public/Private data types
- Interfaces
- Encapsulation
- Implementations of different Classes
### Lessons Learned
- This was a fun project that I had thought about doing long before I realized it was going to be a homework assignment.
One of the biggest problems I had was with the initial set up of the project. When we began the project set up as a class, my router went out on me and it took a few minutes for my router to restart. So the following day I was about to finish up the project and submit it. However I had a few bugs that I couldn't figure out so I asked for help during the T.A. hours. It was SD Will who saved me from failing the project because I wasn't implementing any encapsulation in my classes.  

- Another problem I had with my code, was understanding how to get my program to continue to run with nested for loops, and issues with while loops continuing when they should have stopped the program, and the program not continuing with the next method when it needed too. To better understand how these loops were executing, I would stop and read my loops out loud in English and refactor my code from there.
